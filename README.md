# Project M2: Spectroscopy and Astrophysical Diagnostics 

## Data Analysis project 

#### This project has been carried out during my Master 2 year at the [Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/formation/master/physique/m2-astronomie-et-astrophysique). 

The main aim of the project is to perform *data analysis* on an observational dataset, and then to apply *physical and chemical modelization* in order to infer some key informations about the astrophysical source by fitting the models to the data.

The data analysis part is carried out using python scripts while the modelization is done through a Fortron code. The dataset is obtained from spatial and grounded telescopes such as IRAM, *Hershel*, *Spitzer*, VLT, Sofia and APEX. Before any manipulation, a data reduction is required in order to remove the background noise.
